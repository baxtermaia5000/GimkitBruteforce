How to run the program:
- Download bruteforce.py (click on it and press download)
- You have a few options from here:
- you could make a repl.it account and copy-paste code (don't take credit for it tho)
- you could install linux on chrome and use $ python3 bruteforce.py (will have to pip install imports) (requires more than 2 fucking braincells)
- you could also use some random online IDE for all i care
