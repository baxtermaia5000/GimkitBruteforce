How to run the program:
- Download bruteforce.py (click on it and press download)
- You have a few options from here:
- go to https://replit.com/@MylesOgdahl1/Gimkit-bruteforce and run it there
- you could install linux on chrome, move the file to the newly created linux folder, and use $ python3 bruteforce.py. This is the preferred method, but you will have to run $ pip install <import> when it doesn't work (requires more than 2 fucking braincells)
- you could also use some random online IDE for all i care
